**What is this project?**

A personal project that will help me learn Spring and Hibernate better, while also implementing a MVC framework.

**Is this all work the uploader's?**

Yes, but a different repo was the inspiration for the first commit. 
I looked at the code from https://github.com/pista/developersdatabse (cheers to the human who made this, you are the coolest). 
Using that code, I saw how I can use the Spring framework and JPA library to implement MVC structure. 
After that, I re-wrote the whole code with the project I had in mind and the current code shares no overlap with the repo mentioned above, but I  think it is honest to include this information as the above repo is one of the straight-forwarded (if that's a word) demo of Spring framework I encountered.

**What is the data about?**

The premise is that there is a publishing house known as WolfPubDB that has various publications.
Many people are employed here as editors and authors on a permanent or temporary basis. The publication can be books or issues which will have various editions or articles respectively.
The publishing house keeps a record of the various distributors, their orders and the payments they have made.
This premise was one of my projects during my Masters at North Carolina State University.

**What are the Entities?**

Note: Not everything attribute over here is in the code that is implemented.
This is more of an ER diagram.
